# Systemize

Welcome to Systemize! 

An app that allows you to color code your daily and weekly tasks and activities and check them off as they are completed. See your weekly breakdown and create a profile for yourself!

This application was developed with an idea in mind from Krystina Labanowicz and design wireframes created by Criselda Tejada.
